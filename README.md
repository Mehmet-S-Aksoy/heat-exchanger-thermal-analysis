# Heat Exchanger Thermal CFD Analysis â€“ ANSYS Fluent 

Thermal CFD analysis of a heat exchanger using ANSYS Fluent. Includes temperature, pressure, and flow distribution for convective cooling with cold tubes. 

# Overview

- **Fluid**: Air at 40Â°C entering at 200 L/min
- **Coolant Tubes**: Cooled water at 10Â°C, heat transfer coefficient = 400 W/mÂ²Â·K
- **Reynolds Number**: 5800
- **Solver**: Pressure-based, steady-state
- **Software**: ANSYS Fluent, SpaceClaim, Meshing tools


##  Key Results

- Temperature dropped from 40Â°C to ~18Â°C across the domain.
- High velocity gradient observed around the tube bank.
- Effective heat transfer achieved via water-cooled tubes.
